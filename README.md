## ☢️ Nuclear Kernel — Message to Kali Linux & Kernel Developers

**Nuclear Kernel** is an experimental Linux kernel initiative authored by **KhaninKali**, conceived with the objective of pushing low-level system understanding, kernel behavior analysis, and security-centric experimentation beyond surface-level customization.

This project was never intended as a cosmetic fork or a production-ready kernel.  
It was designed as a **research-driven kernel experiment**, focused on:
- Understanding kernel internals at depth  
- Studying system behavior under unconventional configurations  
- Exploring low-level mechanics relevant to offensive and defensive security  

### 📌 Current Status

The project is currently **incomplete and paused**.

The pause is intentional—not due to lack of vision, but due to:
- The complexity inherent in kernel-level work  
- Resource and time constraints  
- The need for peer-level review and collaboration  

This kernel **must not** be considered stable, secure, or suitable for general users at this stage.

### 📦 Distribution & Intent

The **Nuclear Kernel source is made available strictly for review, evaluation, and collaboration** by experienced developers.

Intended audience:
- Kali Linux maintainers and developers  
- Linux kernel contributors  
- Security engineers and low-level system researchers  

This is **not a request for endorsement**, nor a claim of production readiness.  
It is an **open signal for technical evaluation and serious collaboration**.

### 🧠 Philosophy

Kernel development is not fast.  
Kernel development is not flashy.  
Kernel development is **discipline, patience, and precision**.

This project reflects an **offensive security mindset applied at the kernel layer**—where real control, real defense, and real exploitation potential exists.

Incomplete does not mean abandoned.  
Incomplete means **unfinished, not unconsidered**.

### 👑 Authorship

This project is **independently authored and maintained by KhaninKali**.  
All design decisions, experiments, and implementation paths originate from the author.

External contribution, review, or critique is welcome—  
**authorship claims by others are not**.
